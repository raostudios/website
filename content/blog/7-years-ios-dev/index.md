I want to share my experiances as an developer and thought it would be good documentation for myself and maybe someone else can learn from my experiance.

I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I initially learned to code in an AP class in high school. I entered college as a Computer Engineering major but switched to Mechanical Engineering after I was really bored in a internship in Finance. After I graduated I would do coding side projects after my ME full time job, which was much more boring than the tech in finance internship. I started just experimenting with Google App Engine and learning python. Soon I realized there were really exciting developments in iPhone App development. I quit my job and taught myself iOS development.

## Indie is hard

By the time I launched my first app I was too late for the indie app wave. The App Store had matured, it really favored well established companies with processes and contacts with App Store editors. User acquisition became especially hard. A single indie dev could no longer launch an app and expect to make a good return. 

## Contracting vs Consulting

When I realized indie apps was really hard, I started contracting. Something you quickly realize is everyone has an idea and they want you to build it for free. But I worked on some great projects. Contracting is low risk way to start a business and still generate revenue.

## Picking a Job

Find alignment on business, product and culture. Think about compensation but think about the role 1/2/5 years from now.

## Passion

Know how you perform when you are noth passionate about something. Every job will have days when you have to fix a bug, build a feature or perform other duties that you are not fully passionate about. Find a way to maintain your output and deliver a high quality work product.

## Meetups


## Work can seem tough

When you are in it you never realize what you are accomplishing

## People

### Working with a Product Manager

They think different. They have to focus on implementation and also future plans.

### Working with a designer

Designers are the more artsy type. The good one have eyes like hawks but also know to make astehetic/time to implement tradeoff.

### Collogues can be hard

Everyone has different experiances and values, find a way to match.

Code review are hard on the ego and relationships.

### Working with a manager/tech lead

Show respect for their experiance but also state your opinion.

## Learning a new Codebase

Look for patterns and archtecture in the current code and try to replicate that. Do not rock the boat without a clear direction.

## Learn your tools

Git

Xcode/Instuments

Jira

## Communication

Document everything. Especially tough decisions. Let the team know about any tradeoffs you had to make.

## Deliver

Always deliver what you promise. If you arn't sure you can deliver, don't promise. Document any risks that might cause the project to fail.

## Releases are hard

easy to mess up

## New OS every year

Although there was some intrigue to working on a new OS each year. It died quickly since the new OS's didn't have many new features but we still have to support the new OS and the old ones.

## Googling and Stack Overflow

## Architecture

## Tests & Bugs

## Animations are secondary
